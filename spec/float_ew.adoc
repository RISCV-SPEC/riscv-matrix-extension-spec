For float matrix element-wise arithmetic instructions, matrix-matrix/matrix-vector instruction format are provided. 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit floating point element-wise operations are optionally supported. Both the source and destination registers of float matrix element-wise instructions are accumulation registers.


*  fp16 operand:  legal at follow cases
** legal if 'mfew' and 'mmf16f16' of xmisa register are both set to 1
** legal if 'mfew' and 'mmf8f16' of xmisa register are both set to 1
** legal if 'mfew' and 'mmf16f32' of xmisa register are both set to 1
*  fp32 operand:  legal at follow cases
** legal if 'mfew' and 'mmf32f32' of xmisa register are both set to 1
** legal if 'mfew' and 'mmf16f32' of xmisa register are both set to 1
** legal if 'mfew' and 'mmbf16f32' of xmisa register are both set to 1 
** legal if 'mfew' and 'mmf32f64' of xmisa register are both set to 1 
** legal if 'mfew' and 'mmf8f32' of xmisa register are both set to 1
*  fp64 operand: legal at follow cases 
** legal if 'mfew' and 'mmf64f64' of xmisa register are both set to 1
** legal if 'mfew' and 'mmf32f64' of xmisa register are both set to 1

The matrix operand shape is configured by mtilem and mtilen. The elements out of bound of `mtilem x mtilen` are set to 0 (agnostic).

The legal matrix shapes for 16-bit width operand are:

* mtilem stem:[\le] ALEN/ARLEN
* mtilen stem:[\le] ARLEN/16

The legal matrix shapes for 32-bit width operand are:

* mtilem stem:[\le] ALEN/ARLEN
* mtilen stem:[\le] ARLEN/32

The legal matrix shapes for 64-bit width operand are:

* mtilem stem:[\le] ALEN/ARLEN
* mtilen stem:[\le] ARLEN/64


For matrix-matrix instructions, both sources are matrixs. For matrix-vector instructions, src2 is matrix and src1 is one row of matrix.  Use row0 as an example, the vector operand operates on each row of matrix operand as md[i, j] = ms2[i, j] operations with ms1[0, j].

All floating-point element-wise instructions follow the IEEE-754/2008 standard. All floating-point element-wise instructions that perform rounding can select the rounding mode using the frm field.
