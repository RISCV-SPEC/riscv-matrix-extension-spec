This extension provides a matrix widening BF16 mul-add instruction that accumulates into FP32, illegal if bit[7] of xmisa register is 0.

The legal matrix shape of  mfmacc.s.bf16 is:

* matrixA: M stem:[\le] TLEN/TRLEN, K stem:[\le] TRLEN/16
* matrixB: N stem:[\le] TLEN/TRLEN, K stem:[\le] TRLEN/16
* matrixC: M stem:[\le] TLEN/TRLEN, N stem:[\le] TLEN/TRLEN

Zmbf16 extension requires ELEN>=32.

```
#the input is bf16, the output is fp32, md = md + ms1*ms2
 mfmacc.s.bf16 md, ms2, ms1
```

The matrix extension provides conversion between BF16 values and FP32 values, legal if bit[XLEN-2] and bit[8] of xmisa register are both set to 1. The widen convert instructions use high or low half columns of source register and write to 1 destination register. The narrow covert instructions only modify high or low half columns of destination register. The convert instructions do not depend upon matrix size.

```
#bf16 floating point widen convert to fp32
#convert to high part of md
mfcvth.s.bf16 md, ms1   
#convert to low part of md
mfcvtl.s.bf16 md, ms1   

#fp32 narrow convert to bf16(fp32tobf16)
#convert using high part of ms1
mfcvth.bf16.s md, ms1
#convert using low part of ms1
mfcvtl.bf16.s md, ms1
```

For conversion between fp32 and bf16 , legal if bit[XLEN-2] and bit[7] of xmisa register are both set to 1, illegal in other cases.
