== Introduction
This document is a matrix extension proposal for RISC-V. 

The extension chooses a decoupled architecture from the vector extension for the flexibility and implementation considerations. Each harts supporting the matrix extension defines a RLEN constant parameters. RLEN is the number of bits in a row of a matrix register as described in Section Matrix Registers. The programmer's model is designed to achieve binary portability on harts with different RLEN values.

The extension is strongly inspired by the RISC-V Vector extension.
