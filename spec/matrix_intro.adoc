== Introduction
This document is a matrix extension proposal for RISC-V. 

The extension chooses a decoupled architecture from the vector extension for the flexibility and implementation considerations. Each harts supporting the matrix extension defines a MLEN constant parameters. MLEN is the number of bits in a row of a matrix register as described in Section 1.1. The programmer's model is designed to achieve binary portability on harts with different MLEN values.

The extension is strongly inspired by the RISC-V Vector extension.
