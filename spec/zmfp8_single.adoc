For mfmacc.s.<e5/e4> instruction, the source is E5M2/E4M3 8-bit floating-point, and the result is fp32 result, these instructions are illegal if bit[9]  of xmisa register is 0.

The legal matrix shape of  mfmacc.s.<e5/e4> is:

* matrixA: M stem:[\le] TLEN/TRLEN, K stem:[\le] TRLEN/8
* matrixB: N stem:[\le] TLEN/TRLEN, K stem:[\le] TRLEN/8
* matrixC: M stem:[\le] TLEN/TRLEN, N stem:[\le] TLEN/TRLEN

The mfmacc.s.<e5/e4> instructions requires ELEN>=32.

```
#the input is fp8(E5M2), the output is fp32, md = md + ms1*ms2
 mfmacc.s.e5 md, ms2, ms1
#the input is fp8(E4M3), the output is fp32, md = md + ms1*ms2
 mfmacc.s.e4 md, ms2, ms1
```

For conversion between fp8 and fp32,  legal if bit[XLEN-2] and bit[9] of xmisa register are both set to 1, illegal in all other cases.

The mfcvt<l/h>.<e5/e4>.s instructions are used to convert a single float-point source into a 4x narrower destination. The mfcvtl.<e5/e4>.s write back to the first quater of md and the mfcvth.<e5/e4>.s write back to the second quater of md, the rest parts of md are kept undisturbed.  The matrix size configurations are ignored for mfcvt<l/h>.<e5/e4>.s instructions. 

```
#matrix-matrix floating point 4x narrow convert(fp32tofp8)
#convert the 2nd half of ms1 
mfcvth.e5.s md, ms1
mfcvth.e4.s md, ms1
#convert the 1st half of ms1 
mfcvtl.e5.s md, ms1 
mfcvtl.e4.s md, ms1
```
