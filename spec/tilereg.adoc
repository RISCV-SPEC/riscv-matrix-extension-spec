The matrix extension adds 4 architectural **Tile Registers** (tr0-tr3) for input tile matrices and 4 architectural *Accumulation Registers* (acc0-acc3) for output accumulation matrices.

A **Tile Register** has a fixed TLEN bits of state, where each row has TRLEN bits. As a result, there are TLEN / TRLEN rows for each tile register in logic. Each tile register comprises [M x K] elements, K is TRLEN / element width.

An **Accumulation Register** has a fixed ALEN bits of state, where each row has ARLEN bits. As a result, there are ALEN / ARLEN, which is equal to TLEN/TRLEN rows for each acculation register in logic. 

The ARLEN is derived by TLEN/TRLEN * ELEN, which means the element size of accumulation registers should not be bigger than ELEN.

The size of the matrix registers varies as following when ELEN is 32bit and TLEN is 512bit.

// Introducing of AMUL is to address the mismatched widths issue between input and output matrix of matrix multiplication instructions. The choice of AMUL is based on both the supported matrix multiplication mode and the maximum widening ratio of the supported widening instruction. For certain specific hardware configurations, accumulation registers' width can be narrower or wider than the tile registers' width, which leads to AMUL having a corresponding fractional or integer value. Further details about AMUL will be discussed in next chapter.
